This MATLAB®️ code requires as inputs a 3D numeric array containing the already re-sampled head CT volume of the patient and a trained Gaussian Support Vector Machine classifier. First, a threshold on HU values is applied on the re-sampled CT volume to obtain a binary 3D array where only metal objects are identified (i.e. voxels with HU values higher than the threshold are set to 1, while the others are set to 0). Afterward, the geometric features extraction is carried out on the binary 3D array produced by the thresholding, and a single-patient dataset is built, which contains the six geometric features (Volume, Primary axis length, Secondary axis length, Tertiary axis length, Circularity and Cylinder-similarity) for each of the metal objects identified. Finally, the dataset is fed to the previously trained Gaussian Support Vector Machine classifier, which provides the predicted class for each of the objects included in the dataset. The algorithm produces as output a table containing the six geometric features of each classified object, along with the predicted class and the coordinates of the electrodes centroids.
