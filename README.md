# Automated-localization-of-ECoG-electrodes-in-CT-volumes
This MATLAB®️ code is released as a demo of a method for automated localization of ECoG electrodes in CT volumes.
To start the demo run the script "demo_ecog_electrodes_recognition_CT.m".
Two patients' data are released to support the demo ("patientAdata.mat', "patientBdata.mat"), but, due to their big dimensions, they have not been uploaded in this repository and, instead, they can be downloaded via the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19UFPUDoGJ7WWLL3GH1FtMbBTqZvLh_UT
